AP Exam Multiple Exam Percentage: 8-10%

## Topic 1.1: Introduction to Maps
Understanding maps

---

## Types of Maps

**Reference Maps** - Emphasize the location of a place without using data
**Thematic Maps** - Emphasize spatial patters of places (Uses data to show themes).
**Typographic Map** - Map showing Typography (the shape of the Earth.)

### Reading Maps
1. Check the title.
2. Check the Key/Legend.
3. Check the connection and make a connection to the map.
4. Look at the question

### Absolute Distance vs Relative Distance
**Absolute Distance** - Quantitative (numbers) forms
**Relative Distance** - Qualitative (approximate) forms

### Clustering & Dispersal
**Clustering** - How close things are in a space.
**Dispersal** - How far things are apart in a space.

### Map Projections to Know
**Mercator** - Originally used for travel via the sea, distorts shape and size of land masses but maintains distance and direction.

**Goode Homolosine** - Minimizes distortion due to being an interrupted map (part of the world are removed).

**Fuller** - Does not use cardinal directions, maintains shape & size.

**Robinson** - Spreads distortion across shape, size & direction.

**Winkel Tripel** - Rounder in shape with distortion near the southern and northern poles.

## Topic 1.2: Geographic Data
How Businesses, Individuals, Organizations, etc. use data & how data is collected.

---

### Qualitative v. Quantitative

**Qualitative** - Think more about opinions, less measurable.
**Quantitative** - Think about exact things that focus on data.

### Examples of data collection

**Government** - Census.
**Businesses** - Focus Groups, Polls, and possibly even the Census.
**Individuals** - Surveys and Polls

### Geographic Information System
A system that analyzes, manages and displays lots of information on a particular geographic area.
Can create Layered Maps.
Often Uses GPS

## Topic 1.3: The Power of Geographic Data
Elaborating on Geographic Data

---
### Scale
**Scale**: Distance Ratio that compares the size of something on the map to the size of something on Earth
**Personal, Government, and Organization Scales:**

| Personal | Businesses | Organization | Government |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Looking at schools, crime rates, etc. to better understand the direction of a community, decide where to live, etc. | To better understand their customer base, decide where to put new stores, etc. | Depends on the size of the org. Helps them decide how to best serve the community | Uses them for lots of things. School locations, polling locations, redistricting of voting districts, etc. | 

### Census
An official count of individuals in a population and a collection of demographic data.
Normally every 10 years.
How federal funding is determined.
Helps see where people are moving.
Helps determine redistricting.

## Topic 1.4: Spatial Concepts
---

**Absolute Location** - Uses latitude and longitude, exact location that doesn't move.
**Relative Location** - Uses surroundings, not precise.

### Distance Decay & Space Time Compression

**Space Time Compression** - The increasing sense of connectivity, due to advancements in technology, that reduces the impact of distance decay.
**Distance Decay** - The effect of distance on cultural or spatial interactions (The further the distance apart, the less interaction will occur).

### Place

When Geographers discuss **Place** they break it down into 2 groups:
**Physical characteristics** - Rivers, Mountains, Vegetation, and Climate
**Human characteristics** - Religion, Language, Population, and Other Demographic Information

## Topic 1.5: Human-Environmental Interaction
Constant back and forth between the environment and between society.

---

### Sustainability
Is the current generation using their resources in a way that does not damage the environment for future generations

### Environmental Possibles vs Determinism 
**Environmental Possibles** -  The belief that the physical environment plays a role in the success of a society, but the culture can overcome environmental factors.
**Environmental Determinism** - The belief that the environment determines the success of a society.

## Topic 1.6: Scales of Analysis

**Scale of Analysis**: Observation of data at the global, national, regional, and local scale. (The focus is how the data is organized & presented on the map)

**Scale of Inquiry** - Asking what the best scale of analysis possible would be for a given map

**Small Scale** - Zoomed out map

**Large Scale** - Zoomed in map

Different scales and scales of analysis help geographers to analyze.

## Topic 1.7: Regional Analysis

--- 

**Region** - An area that is grouped together by perceived or measurable common characteristics (i.e. language, culture, topography, etc.)

Regions can be observed on a variety of scales, allowing us to observe different data.

### Types of Regions
- **Formal** (Uniform) - Geographic area with common characteristics. *Note: some formal regions have boundaries that can shift.*
- **Functional** (Nodal) - Geographic area organized around a center point. (normally Transportation, Economic, Communication) (i.e. TV Station, Disney World, Mall of America, Airport, etc.)
- **Vernacular** (Perceptual) - Geographic area with precised common characteristics. (Causes lots of debates.)
