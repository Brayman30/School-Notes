# Population & Migration Patterns & Processes
What youâ€™ll learn about: The patterns associated with human populations.
AP Exam Multiple Exam Percentage: 12-17%

---

## Topic 2.1: Population Distribution
Why would someone live in this location versus that location?

---

Human factors that influence the distribution of human populations:
1. Economic Factors
2. Political Factors
3. Cultural Factors
4. Historical Factors

### Types of Population Density

**Arithmetic Density** - $\frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Amount Of Land}}$
	Shows how spread out people are.
**Physiological Density** - $\frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Arable Land}}$
	Shows how much stress is being put on the land.
**Agricultural Density** - $\frac{\text{Number of Farmers}}{\text{Arable Land}}$ 
	Shows how advanced the society is, the lower the number, the more people are free to do other jobs that aren't farming.

## Topic 2.2: Consequences of Population Distribution
Populations are changing all over the world

---

### Main Population Growth Centers of the World
1. South Asia
2. Southeast Asia
3. East Asia
4. Europe (Slowing down)

### Population Density vs Distribution

**Population Density** - How many people are living in this one spot.
**Population Distribution** - How are people located.
Density allows geographers to understand a lot about a state.

### Carrying Capacity
How many people can live in an area without causing harm to the environment.
If the carrying capacity is exceeded, things will go real bad, real quick.


## Topic 2.3: Population Composition
Looking at age structures, demographic data, gender data, and Population Pyramids

---

### Population Pyramids
Example of a population pyramid of Angola (2005)
![[img/Angola_population_pyramid_2005.svg]]
- Shows age ranges, including pre-reproductive years, reproductive years, and post-reproductive years. 
- Broken down by gender, shows how society is operating and also possible historical events.
- Less kids (Low Birth Rate) = More economically advanced
- More kids (High Birth Rate) = Less economically advanced
- Working Age Men (Guest Workers) - They exist!
- Large drop off - Just men - External War - Men & Women - Internal War


## Topic 2.4: Population Dynamics
CBR, CDR, NIR, TFR

---

**Crude Birth Rate** - Total number of live births in a year for every 1,000 people alive.
**Crude Death Rate** - Total number of deaths in a year for every 1,00 people alive.
**Natural Increase Rate** - The percentage a population grows by in a year.
**Total Fertility Rate** - The average number of children a woman will give birth to in their lifetime. (2.1 replaces the current population)

#### Economic Advances
As the economy advances, deaths go down and people lives longer.\
**Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)** - Total Number of deaths of children less than 1 year old for every 1,00 people alive.
	Goes down as the economy advances
Creates hospitals and clinics, decreases IMR, etc.

## Topic 2.5: The Demographic Transition Model

![[img/Demographic-TransitionOWID.png]]
This chart basically has everything needed.

**Int*er*regional Migration*** - Movement from one region of a country to another
**In*ra*regional Migration** - Movement within one region of a country.

###  Epidemiological Theroy
Diseases are connected to the DTM, concerend diseases change by stage.

## Topic 2.6: Malthusian Theory

Tohmas Malthus belived population would grow exponentially and ood would only grow expeniontally.

## Topic 2.7: Population Polices



## Topic 2.8: Women & Demographic Changes



## Topic 2.9: Aging Populations



## Topic 2.10: Causes of Migration



## Topic 2.11: Forced and Voluntary Migration



## Topic 2.12: Effects of Migration
