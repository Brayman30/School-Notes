## **Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus** (CHONP) are the most important compounds for life.

## Water

### **Water** is important becuase it is **polar** and has **Hydrogen Bonds.**
- Oxygen is more **electronegitive** than Hydrogen, so unequal sharing forms a polarity, with the Hydrogens being positive and the Oxygen being negiative. 
	- This is called a polar covelant bond (becuase it is unequally shared.)
	- This also causes cohesion, adhesion, and surface tension between water molecules, due to the hydrogen bonds between different water molecules.
		- **Cohesion** is formed between water and water.
		- **Adhesion** is formed between water and another substance (i.e. plant cellulose.)

### Water can be used to **break and form bonds.**
- **Hydrolysis** adds a water to break a bond, and thus split one molecule into two.
	- Used to breakdown ATP into ADP to release energy in an **exergonic** reaction.
- **Dehydration Sythesis** removes a water to allow a new bond to form.
	- Used to attach a Phosphate group to ADP to form ATP in an **endergonic** reaction.

## Strucutre and function of polymers are derived from the way their monomers function
### In **nucleic acids,** genetic infromation is encoded in sequences of **nucelotide monomers.** 
- Contain a **five-carbon sugar (pentose sugar)** such as dexoyribose (**D**NA) or ribose (**R**NA).
- Contian a **phospahte group** (CHON**P**)
- Contain a **nitrogen base** (Adenine, thymine, guanine, cytosinem or uracil) that actually stores the genetic infromation.

### In proteins, the specific order of amino acids (known as **primary structure**) determines the overall shape of the protein. 
- **shape determines function**.
- All Amino Acids have the same basic structure except their R group.
- **Secondary Stucture** is formed by alpha helicies and beta pleated sheet.
- **Teirtery Structure** is formed through bonds between different parts of the amino acid.
- **Quaternary Strucutre** is formed through the interactions between 2+ amino acid sequences. 

### Complex Carbohydrates comprise sugar molecules whose strucutres determine the properties and function of the molecules.


## Lipids
- **Nonpolar** macromolecules
- DIfferences in **saturation** determine the **structure and function** of lipids
	- **Phospholipids** have both polar heads (that interact with other polar molecules i.e. water) and nonpolar tails that are often hydrophobic

## Nucleic Acids
- Directional, with both a 5' and 3' end.
- New Nucelotides are added to the 3' end.
- DNA is tructured as an **antiparallell double helix**
	- This means it has 2 strands, each running in the opposite 5' to 3' direction.

## Proteins
- Amino Acids are connected by peptide bonds. 
- As discussed before, proteins are formed by primary, secondary, tiertiary and quatonary structures.
