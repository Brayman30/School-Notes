# Cell Communication & Cell Division

## Chapter 5.6 - Cell Communication
How does a cell tell another cell something? **A Ligand** - A signal molecule.

### 3 Stages:
#### 1. Reception
Cellular signal is received in the form of a ligand.
Some receptors are Intracellular, others are on the membrane.
	Ligands for Intracellular Receptors must be able to diffuse through the membrane $\therefore$ they must be hydrophobic, nonpolar, molecules that are usually lipid-based.  

#### G-Protein Receptors
Acts like an on off switch

#### Receptor Tyrosine Kinase
Another type of receptor

#### 2. Transduction
Cellular signal is taken in and moved through the cell to eventually cause some response.
A Longer transduction pathway is better since it allows for easier **regulation** and possible **amplification**.

##### Phosphorylation Cascade
Involves 2 Enzymes:
1. Protein Kinase - Adds Phosphates (Activates)
2. Protein Phosphates - Removes Phosphates (Deactivates)

##### 2nd  Messengers
Another secondary molecule used to transduce a signal that is not part of the phosphorylation cascade.
Ex: cAMP (cyclic Adenosine Mono Phosphate), Calcium Ions

#### 3. Response
The cell responds to the transduced signal in some way.
Responses fall into 3 categories:
1. Regulate Genetic Information 
2. Regulate Enzymes
3. Change Cellular Shape

### Apoptosis
Cell Suicide 
Reasons for:
1. Received Death Signal Ligand
2. Problem with DNA
3. Problem with Proteins
4. Normal Embryonic Development

#### Normal v. Apoptosis Comparison
| Normal Cell | Apoptosis Cell |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| No Death Signal Ligand Present | Death Signal Ligand may be present |
| CED-9 Active, producing inhibitors for: | CED-9 Inactive, not producing inhibitors for: |
| CED-4 & CED-3 Inactive due to inhibitors from CED-9 | CED-4 & CED-3 are active since they are uninhibited, producing **Proteases** and **Nucleases** that will break down Proteins and Nucleotides Respectively |
| | Blebs will be formed to contain broken down chemicals |

## Chapter  9 - Cell Cycle & Mitosis
Cells in Multicellular organisims replicate (undergo mitosis) for Growth & Replacement.
Cells in Unicellular organisims replicate (undergo mitosis) to reproduce asexually.

### Phases of Mitosis
#### Interphase
Makes up most of the cell cycle
##### $G_1$ Phase
Cell functions normally, organelles double in number ($\therefore$ cell doubles in size).
##### $S$ Phase
Chromosomes replicate, forming sister chromotids.
##### $G_2$ Phase
Centrioles are prepared, etc.
#### $M$ Phase
Contains both Mitosis and Cytokinesis
##### Prophase (Mitosis)
Chromosomes condensed
Nucleus still present
##### Metaphase (Mitosis)
Chromosomes line along equator
Centrioles & Kinetochore microtubules visible
##### Anaphase (Mitosis)
Chromosomes pulled to equators of cell
Non-Kinetochore microtubules visible
##### Telophase (Mitosis)
Cell plate or cleavage furrow begins to form
##### Cytokinesis
Cell splits

### Binary Fission
Prokaryotes are unable to undergo mitosis since they do not have any Centrioles $\therefore$ they undergo a process called **Binary Fission.** 

### Cell Cycle Control System
There are 3 Regulating Checkpoints of the Cell Cycle, Listed below in a chart:
| Checkpoint Phase | Internal or External | Checks for? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $G_1$ | External | Presence of a Growth Factor |
| $G_2$ | Internal | Presence of MPF (Maturation Promotion Factor, a compound formed from CDK (Cyclin Dependent Kinase, a chemical always present in the cell) and Cyclin (A chemical which accumulates throughout $S$ phase and $G_2$ Phase.))
| $M$ | Internal | Proper Kinetochore-to-Microtubule Attachment |

Loss of control of the cell cycle can lead to the development of **cancer.**

#### Density Dependent Inhibition
Crowded cells should stop dividing.

#### Anchorage Dependency
Cells not attached to a surface should not divide.

## Chapter 10 - Meiosis 

### Mitosis v. Meiosis 
| Mitosis | Meiosis |
| --- | --- |
| Diploid (2n)| Haploid (n) |
| Somatic | Gametes  
| Asexual | Sexual |
| 2 Daughter Cells | 4 Daughter cells |
| 5 Stages | 10 Stages |
| Separates Sister Chromotids | Separates Homologous Chromosomes |
| 1 DNA Replication | 1 DNA Replication |
| --- | Crossovers |
| --- | Forms Tetrads |

### Sources of Genetic Diversity in Meiosis 
#### Crossovers
When a **Chiastmata** occurs during **Synapisis** (the forming of **tetrads**), there is the possibility of a **Crossover.** Where genetic information is exchanged between homologous chromosomes, creating a **recombinant** chromosome.
Occurs during Prophase

#### Independent Assortment
During Metaphase, each pair of sister chromosomes is able to link up with the other in one of 2 ways.
##### Formula for Independent Assortment 
$2^n$ where $n$ is the haploid number

#### Random Fertilization
The specific gametes that unite to form the zygote are not necessarily always they same and therefore add more diversity to the set of possible offspring.

#### Mutations
Random Mutations are also possible.

### Male vs female gametes
In males, 4 functional gametes are formed.
Whereas, in females only 1, much larger, functional gamete is formed. The rest become **polar bodies**.
